<h2>James making money</h2>
<p>James will earn $19 million for his first four years with the Cavs, an amount
   that seems downright insignificant when compared to his endorsements. In a
   sponsorship deal that will pay James more than any other basketball player
except Michael Jordan, Nike signed the player to a seven-year, $90 million
contractâ€”and that contract was signed before James had even inked a deal with
the Cavs. He has also agreed to promote Coca-Cola products, including Sprite
and Powerade, and bubblegum. Nike released the first shoe endorsed by James,
the Air Zoom Generation, in December of 2003. At $110 a pair, Nike sold 72,000
pairs in the first month alone.</p>
<h2>James business interests</h2>
<p>James has taken a unique approach to his playing contracts, usually opting to
   sign shorter term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility.
   In 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract
   extension instead of the four year maximum as it allotted him the option of
   seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following
    the 2010 season. James took less money in order for Miami to be able to afford
    Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade as well as further roster support. In 2014, he
    rejoined Cleveland on a two-year contract worth $42.1 million with an option
    to become a free agent again in 2015. The next offseason, he opted out of the
 contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers on another two-year contract with a
 player option for the second year.</p>
