<h2>James making money</h2>
<p>James will earn $19 million for his first four years with the Cavs, an amount
   that seems downright insignificant when compared to his endorsements. In a
   sponsorship deal that will pay James more than any other basketball player
except Michael Jordan, Nike signed the player to a seven-year, $90 million
contractâ€”and that contract was signed before James had even inked a deal with
the Cavs. He has also agreed to promote Coca-Cola products, including Sprite
and Powerade, and bubblegum. Nike released the first shoe endorsed by James,
the Air Zoom Generation, in December of 2003. At $110 a pair, Nike sold 72,000
pairs in the first month alone.</p>
